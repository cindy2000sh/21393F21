## CMU Spring 2022 Scheduling

### Notes
- Each item is a full day schedule for the first/second half of the semester, because we have half semester mini courses.
- Only undergraduate courses are considered. 
- Courses are assigned as late as possible. (My team members and I stay up late >_<) 
- Each classroom are maximally utilized in a greedy sense. (i.e. if there are 100 seats in a classroom, it's unreasonable if only 10 seats are used.)
- Visit repo to see my code and our report. But many raw inputs are unreleased in repo because of privacy issues.
